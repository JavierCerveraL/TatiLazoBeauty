        </li>

    </ul>

    <h5 class=" text-center pb-3"><u>Refills</u></h5>
    <ul class="mb-5">
        <li>Refill services receive a complimentary lash bath (highly suggested).</li>
        <li>Make sure you book the <b>correct service</b>. Example; If you book a 45 min touch up then
            that is all the time you are going to get.</li>
        <li>Clients who show up to their refill appointment with poor retention will have the following
                options;</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pay for a fullset (only if there's enough time).</li>
                    <li>Pay the refill price but only get 50% - 60% of your lashes filled.</li>
                    <li>If neither of these work for you, you can cancel your appointment and rebook another
                        time (last minute cancellation fee is required).</li>
                </ol>
        <li>It is the clients responsibility to let me know ahead of time if they're having any problems
        with their lashes. Clients will need to provide <b>good quality</b>  pictures and videos of their
        eyes.</li>        
        <li>You must have 70% - 80% of lash extensions left for a <b>one week (4-7 days) touch up</b> 
            refill.</li>
        <li>You must have no less than 40% - 50% of your lash extensions left for a <b>two week (8-14
            days)</b>  refill.</li>
        <li>You must have no less than 40% - 50% of your lash extensions left for a <b>three week
            (15-21 days)</b>  refill.</li>
        <li>If you notice poor retention 1-3 days after getting your lashes done, you will need to
            provide <b>good quality</b>  pictures/videos no more than 3 days after for me to accept a
            complimentary <b>OR </b> $20 touch up. The touch up must be done <b>1-5 days</b>  after the initial
            appointment (with the <b>same </b> amount of lashes).
        </li>  <br>
        <p><strong>*Note*</strong> I personally need my lashes filled every 10-14 days due to having oily skin, fast lash
        shedding, humidity, etc. Everybody is different and your lashes <b>MAY NOT </b> last the full three
        weeks.</p>
    </ul>




    <h5 class=" text-center pb-3"><u>Weak/ Damaged / Poor Natural Lashes </u></h5>
    <ul class="mb-5">
        <li>Unfortunately, I<b> will not</b>  work on clients (especially those who want long/dramatic
            lashes) if they have <b>weak/damaged/poor natural lashes</b></li>


        <li><strong> Retention is different for everyone.</strong> Here are some of the reasons you may experience
        poor retention; stress, aging (hair loss & weak lashes), wearing masks/face shields,
        steam/saunas, heat, new medications, oily skin, picking/pulling, not cleansing everyday
        properly, not using a proper lash wash, skin care, side sleepers ETC.</li> <br>
        <p>** Please book a 15 minute free consultation on my website if you are not sure if your natural
            lashes are in good condition.**</p> <br>

    </ul>

    <h5 class=" text-center pb-3"><u>DISCOUNTS (can't be combined with other discounts)</u></h5>
    <ul class="mb-5">
        <li>$15 off an eyelash service on the <b>month </b> of your birthday with proof of ID. ♥ (does not
            apply to $20 touch up) </li>
        <li>$20 off any eyebrow lamination service if you book with a lash service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class=" text-center pb-3"><u>Other</u></h5>
    <ul class="mb-5">
        <li>Please <b>avoid</b>  using your phone during your appointment.</li>

        <li><strong>Please let me know if you have any problems, questions or concerns.</strong></li>
        <li>If you do not drive please <b>ask me</b>  to let you know 20 minutes before the appointment is
            done so that I can help you call your ride.</li>
        <li>If you wear eye contacts, please bring your eye contact case or wear glasses for your
            appointment (certain appointments require you to keep your eyes closed for a long
            period of time).</li>
        <li>No refunds. Please book a patch test if you're worried about an allergic reaction.</li>


        
            <li>Refer back to the appointment duration time to know how long your appointment will
                take.</li>
            <li>Perfection takes time. Rushing your
            appointments may result in no longer being able to book with tatilazobeauty.</li>
            <li><b>Please</b> try to stay still during your appointments. Everyone signs consent forms prior to
                appointments agreeing that they are able to lay still for the whole procedure.</li> 
            <li>Please feel free to bring headphones to your appointment </li>
